# AI417-Students_Emotion_Detection_Model

To achieve UPM's objective of providing excellent academic programs and a supportive learning environment for students, a deep learning-based model for emotion detection using face recognition can be designed and developed. This model can help monitor student engagement and emotional responses to learning materials during lectures. Additionally, it can be used for statistical research to analyse student reactions to various activities and events organized by different entities at UPM (e.g., clubs) to rank them based on their positive influence.

Overall, this project will help the instructors gain insights into the effectiveness of their teaching methods and adjust them as needed. In addition, it offers objective measures of emotional responses, allowing for better-informed decision-making regarding future actions. In the end, this will lead to in a more productive and interesting learning environment for UPM students.
